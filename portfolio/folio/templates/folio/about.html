<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have over 8 years experience as a food photographer and have shot for a variety of restaurants in LA from quickservice to fine dining including the iconic Langer's Deli, Kogi Taco Trucks, Salt's Cure, and Jitlada.  I am a natural born foodie and am always looking for new and exciting places to eat.  I fear very little when it comes to new dishes.</p>
<p>I love to chat shop and am always open to helping others achieve great food photography shots.  Ideally I always recommend a seat near a window as it gives a very soft and diffused light that makes for some great shots.  Also, never shoot from the same direction the light hits the dish.  I suggest at least 30-180 degrees from the direction of your light source.  Though at 180 degrees you will have to be careful to avoid flare from your light source and you might want to have some kind of white object, whether it be your t-shirt, a piece of paper, or napkin to reflect some light back into the shadows.</p>
<p>Of course, at night, you can replicate window lighting if you can carry a little flash light.  Have a friend hold up a translucent white napkin and shoot the flash light through it.  This makes a makeshift lightbox.  Though not ideal, it works in a pinch.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have absolutely no control of the lighting what so ever, just concentrating on getting that perfect composition and getting good exposure.  Cameras on phones have become incredible these days and a majority of those amazing shots you see on Instagram are taken on an iPhone, Galaxy S, Xperia Z, etc.  These are just a few tips.  That you might find useful.  Of course, if you like, you can hire me and I can show you my process first hand.  Thanks for stopping by and perusing through my site.</p>
